                <h2>Caesar cipher</h2>
                <p>A Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.</p>
                <p>For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' would be replaced by 'D', 'B' would become 'E', and so on. This method is named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it to protect his military communications.</p>
                <p>While the Caesar cipher is easy to understand and implement, it is also relatively insecure by modern standards. It can be easily broken using frequency analysis or brute-force attacks, as there are only 25 possible shifts in the English alphabet.</p>
                <p>Despite its simplicity, the Caesar cipher laid the groundwork for more complex encryption methods and remains a popular example in educational settings to illustrate the concepts of encryption and cryptography.</p>

                <h2>Example</h2>
                <h2>The transformation can be represented by aligning two alphabets; the cipher is the plain alphabet rotated left or right by some number of positions. For instance, here is a Caesar cipher using a left rotation of three places, equivalent to a right shift of 23 (the shift parameter is used as the key):

                Plain	A	B	C	D	E	F	G	H	I	J	K	L	M	N	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W	X	Y	Z
                Cipher	X	Y	Z	A	B	C	D	E	F	G	H	I	J	K	L	M	N	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W
    When encrypting, a person looks up each letter of the message in the "plain" line and writes down the corresponding letter in the "cipher" line.
